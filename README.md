# Pustak
Pustak is a platform designed to connect book donors with those who need them the most, fostering a culture of learning, sharing, and sustainability. Our mission is simple: to ensure that no book goes unread and no learner goes unsupported. Through Pustak, donors can easily contribute books they no longer need, while recipients gain access to valuable resources that can transform their lives. With a transparent system that authenticates every donation and rewards donors for their generosity, Pustak ensures trust and efficiency at every step. Whether you’re looking to declutter your shelves or help someone on their educational journey, Pustak makes it effortless and impactful. Together, let’s build a future where knowledge knows no boundaries!
